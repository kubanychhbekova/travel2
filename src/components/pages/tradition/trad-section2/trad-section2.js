                        <b>Weddings</b><br/>
                        As in any culture, a Kyrgyz wedding is considered the most colorful event and even turns into a whole series of celebrations. If the girl was wooed, then the parties discussed in advance all the conditions of the wedding, the size of the "kalym" (ransom). Her parents arranged "kyz uzatuu" (seeing her off from her parents' house). Matchmakers brought there "kiyit" (valuable gifts to matchmakers) and gave "kalym". After the blessing of her parents, the girl was taken to the groom's house, where a white scarf was put on her. A "nike" (religious wedding) was already taking place in the groom's house, and they were assigned "okul ata, okul ene" (planted parents).<br/>
                        <br/>
                        The main traditions that every Kyrgyz should remember
                        After the wedding night, the relatives checked the underwear to make sure that their daughter-in-law was a virgin. In this case, the girl's mother, in gratitude for a good upbringing, made a separate monetary gift. The next day, all new relatives came to see the daughter-in-law, at the meeting she had to bow to them three times. Over time, this part of the wedding tradition has been forgotten, and the daughters-in-law bow only for the first few days.

                        <b>Etiquette for kelinki and kayynzhurt</b><br/>
                        In the new family, there were customs of prohibition in relation to the daughter-in-law. In the old days, she was forbidden to call her husband's relatives, she had to come up with some kind of pseudonyms. For example, she called her husband's youngest brother "kichuu bala" (the youngest son), and addressed her husband's younger sister as "erke kyz" (a spoiled girl). This prohibition was in effect throughout the woman's life, and even in old age she had to show the appropriate attitude to her husband's relatives.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        The daughter-in-law was also forbidden to walk with her head uncovered, barefoot, and sit with her back to relatives. She had to speak without raising her tone, wear modest long clothes. After the wedding, the relatives took turns inviting the newlyweds to visit and introduced them to their family. It was called "otko kirghizuu".<br/>
                        <br/>
                        In the new family, the daughter-in-law stood at the very bottom of the hierarchy, which means she had to do all the housework. In addition to everything, she had to help in all the activities of all her husband's relatives, whether it was weddings or funerals. This is called "kelindik kyzmat" (kelinok service).<br/>
                        <br/>
                        But at the same time, in relation to the daughter-in-law, the new relatives had to observe etiquette. In the new family, she had to be treated with respect, care, not to embarrass her, not to be rude, not to violate her personal space, not to appear in front of her in an unsightly way.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Now the relationship within the family is gradually changing, as conflicts often arise on domestic grounds, but the main idea of these traditions is that both sides should show equal respect to each other.<br/>
