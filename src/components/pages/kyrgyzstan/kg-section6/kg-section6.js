                    <h1>The cuisine of Kyrgyzstan.</h1>
                    <p>
                       In modern Kyrgyzstan, almost in every part of it, you can meet any dish of Uzbek, Russian, Turkish or Iranian cuisine. The Kyrgyz people, of course, have their own<br/> culinary traditions, just because of the nomadic past, <b>Kyrgyz cuisine</b> is not particularly diverse.<br/>
                       For example, chicken dishes are completely absent from the national menu, because the breeding of these birds required sedentariness. But all kinds of options for<br/> <b>fried and baked lamb</b> are presented here in the assortment. This was required again by a nomadic lifestyle, because in a hot climate, you can save meat only by<br/> frying it or wilting it.<br/>
                       The brightest representatives of the native <b>Kyrgyz cuisine</b> are various versions of horse meat sausages. The most revered variety is <b>chuchuk,</b>where a piquant taste<br/> is achieved by more fatty varieties of meat and smoking. Many other snacks and dishes, such as <b>karta</b> and <b>karyn,</b> are prepared from horse meat. Fragrant and<br/> hearty <b>beshbarmak </b>is also very common.<br/>
                       But, as it was said earlier, pilaf, <b>manti, chuchpara</b> and many other dishes from the cuisines of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkey, as well as Uighur dishes have long<br/> been firmly included in the culture of the people. The Great Silk Road had a great influence in this cuisine mix, the merit of which was in the transfer of not only<br/> goods, but also cultural features.<br/>
                       <b>Honey</b> is especially revered in Kyrgyzstan. Consumed with local tortillas, it can sometimes be the main dish for breakfast. Locals also have a positive attitude to a<br/> variety of fruits - they are visible and invisible in all bazaars of the country in the summer and autumn period. Apples from Issyk-Kul are rightfully considered one of<br/> the best in the world! Pumpkin is very much loved by Kyrgyz people from vegetables.<br/>
                       A large layer in the national Kyrgyz cuisine is occupied by fermented milk drinks: koumiss, tan, <b>ayran.</b> They can be bought at any bazaar, in any store, and even<br/> along mountain roads.<br/>
                       Kyrgyz people eat mainly on a <b>dasturkhan</b> (dastarkhan) - a narrow tablecloth spread on the floor. If you are lucky enough to be invited, and this is very likely due to<br/> the hospitality of the Kyrgyz, you need to remember several important rules: you should take food only with your right hand; when sitting down, your legs should not<br/> be directed towards the <b>dosturkhan,</b> it is better to tuck them under you or pull them to the side. Sneezing at the table is also a negative attitude.
