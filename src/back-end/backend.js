The gorge received its status as a nature reserve in 1963 and retains it to this day, because it is one of the few places on the planet where a dense relic forest of Tien Shan spruce has been preserved. The hot springs of Altyn-Arashan are also widely known. They are located at a record height of 2,600 meters and have a healing effect due to the content of radon and hydrogen sulfide in the water, maintaining a high temperature all year round: 35 degrees for a radon source and 41 degrees for a hydrogen sulfide source. Some springs have indoor pools, while others are still \"wild\", located in baths or grottoes hollowed out in the stones.",
