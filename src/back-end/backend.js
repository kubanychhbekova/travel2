And our company will easily help you to carry out this kind of \"mental treatment\".",

            "Back in the days of the Soviet Union, the territory of the gorge was recognized as a specially protected protected area due to the great natural diversity of the gorge. The gorge received its status as a nature reserve in 1963 and retains it to this day, because it is one of the few places on the planet where a dense relic forest of Tien Shan spruce has been preserved. The hot springs of Altyn-Arashan are also widely known. They are located at a record height of 2,600 meters and have a healing effect due to the content of radon and hydrogen sulfide in the water, maintaining a high temperature all year round: 35 degrees for a radon source and 41 degrees for a hydrogen sulfide source. Some springs have indoor pools, while others are still \"wild\", located in baths or grottoes hollowed out in the stones.",
